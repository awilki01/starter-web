Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. My father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. Sonny, please don't do anything. Please don't do anything. Only don't tell me you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry. Michael, you never told me you knew Johnny Fontane!

Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child. You can act like a man! Never let anyone know what you are thinking. When they come... they come at what you love.

I'm your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over! Very well. You want to do business with me. I will do business with you. It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes. You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me?



The hotel, the casino. The Corleone Family wants to buy you out. That's my family Kay, that's not me. I want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow. And one more thing. Don't you contact me again, ever. From now on, you deal with Turnbull. I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse. Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.
